funny things. Don't be offended because you might just be hearing, Norfuk. This language can only be 
found on this island and it is a variant of Pitkern spoken on far off Pitcairn Island. These languages 
are a blend of eighteenth century English and Tahitian which was formed from the mutineers of the Bounty 
whom rebelled against the British and returned back to marry local women in Tahiti. They later fled to 
Pitcairn and later were invited to settle on Norfolk Island.</p>
